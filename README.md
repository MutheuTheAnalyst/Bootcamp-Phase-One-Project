# Performing EDA on Selected Box office Movies.

## Business Problem.

**- Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun.**

**- They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies.**

**- You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.**

**- You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.**

## Business Problem Solution.

- In this project, I use the  **'movie_gross'** dataset ( availed by the institution, obtained through web scrapping) to gain insights that will offer solutions to the business problem.

- My **aim** is to **perform exploratory data analysis** on the dataset **using the 'Python Programming Language'** on the **Jupyter Notebook IDE** and **draw meaningful insights** in regards to the **performance of different movies** at the Box office.

## Dataset Overview.

- The dataset contains 3387 records and a total of 5 columns namely; title, studio,domestic_gross,foregn_gross, and year.

- Upon inspection, the dataset contained null values of insignificant impact, thus I dropped the null values.

- I then renamed the 'domestic gross' column to 'domestic gross($)',the 'foreign gross' column to 'foreign gross($)', and then formatted bot columns to numerical values.
